  This book compiles an incomplete collection of essays, tips, rants
  and other useful information for the aspiring photographer and
  photographerette using vintage cameras.

  The focus is clearly non-digital photography, but most things are still
  valid in the digital world as only the medium and some of the technology
  change but neither the light, subjects and the deeper feeling for the art do change.

  I started this book titled Analogue Photography Book but since changed it to Vintage Photography
  as the term "analogue" is a bit misleading as the sensors of digital cameras are analogue
  as well but process the signals into digits instantly. "Film photography" might be a
  little bit more correct, but what about large format cameras that use plates instead of film?
  And in most languages film is a synonym to moving pictures. To draw a line,
  use whatever you want, but my future, as the Lomographic Society claims it:
  <em>The future is analogue.</em>
